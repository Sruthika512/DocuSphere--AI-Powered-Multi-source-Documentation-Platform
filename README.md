# DocuSphere--AI-Powered-Multi-source-Documentation-Platform
DocuSphere – Your AI-Powered Documentation Companion
DocuSphere is an advanced AI-driven documentation platform built to automate the creation of professional project documentation. It accepts multiple input formats — including code snippets, transcripts, informal chats, and audio — and uses pre-trained AI models to summarize everything into a structured Markdown-based document, which can then be exported as a PDF.
This helps new team members understand a project instantly without lengthy onboarding sessions or meetings.
